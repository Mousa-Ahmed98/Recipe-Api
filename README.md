## üçâ Overview 
RecipeRealm is a web application that allows users to explore a wide variety of recipes, share their own recipes, and engage in discussions with other food enthusiasts. The project was developed as part of a summer internship, and it served as a learning experience.

Throughout the development process, we gained practical experience in various aspects of software development, including requirement analysis, system design, implementation, and project management. We had the opportunity to apply our programming skills and learn new technologies to build a functional and user-friendly food blog platform.
